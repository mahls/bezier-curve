# ðŸŒ€ BÃ©zier Curve Visualizer

A minimal SFML-based C++ application for visualizing quadratic BÃ©zier curves interactively. It allows you to adjust the curve's progression using keyboard input and see the construction process step by step.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of quadratic BÃ©zier curve construction
- Step-through interpolation using the UP and DOWN arrow keys
- Control points and intermediate lines clearly drawn
- Uses SFML for 2D graphics rendering
- Lightweight and easy to modify for learning or experimentation
